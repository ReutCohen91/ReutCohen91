 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ReutCohen91
 I'm a second year student in the Open University of Israel, studying 
 Computer science and Cognitive science. I also volunteer in SheCodes - 
 a platform for women who are interested in computers and technology 
 trying to pull more women into technological jobs in Israel.
